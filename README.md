The HTML + CSS are provided by SoftUni, the JS scripts, however, I made by me. The only exception is the Dynamic Web Page, which is entirely created by me. 
There is a document in each folder, containing the tasks. 
Some of the tasks have image or gif with the end result. 
For DOM and DOM Manipulation we can access the HTML files to see the functionality for the task.
