# JSAdvanced

01. Syntax
02. Array
03. Object
04. DOM
05. DOM Manipulation (Create and Append HTML Elements, add Event Listeners, etc)

The HTML + CSS are provided by SoftUni, the JS scripts, however, I made by me. 
There is a document in each folder, containing the tasks. 
Some of the tasks have image or gif with the end result. 
For DOM and DOM Manipulation we can access the HTML files to see the functionality for the task.
