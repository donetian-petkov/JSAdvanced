# JSAdvanced

01. Syntax, Functions and Statements
02. Arrays and Nested Arrays
03. Objects and Composition
04. DOM
05. DOM Manipulation (Create and Append HTML Elements, add Event Listeners, etc)
06. Advanced Functions

The HTML + CSS are provided by SoftUni, the JS scripts, however, I made by me. 
There is a document in each folder, containing the tasks. 
Some of the tasks have image or gif with the end result. 
For DOM and DOM Manipulation we can access the HTML files to see the functionality for the task.
